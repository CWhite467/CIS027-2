                    HTML stands for Hypertext Mark-up Language, it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee 
                    in 1991. Tim Berners-Lee is also the inventor of the world wide web (www) in 1989, 
                    developed on the lanuage which became the pinnicle of how web sites are developed today.
                </p>

                <p>
                   www Browsers use HTML's set of markup symbols or codes to interpret how the items 
                   which make up the website are visually displayed on the screen. These 'Codes' and 
                   'markup text' are often refferd to by the developer in HTML as 'Tags'. These elements 
                   are often divided into a start tag and '/' end tag such as "< p >< /p >" for paragraphs and 
                   "< a >< /a >" for links (without spaces). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Formally Recommended by the <a href= "..\test\webstandards.html">W3C</a>, HTML has expanded 
                    and adapted through the years to incorporate new functions and improve usability. There are 
                    many different versions of HTML which have progressively changed the way websites are navigated, 
                    viewed and behave.

            <div class="info-container">
                <p>
                    In 1993, Dave Raggett drafted the superset of HTML which allowed designs to encompass features such as tables, 
                    figures and forms. It was gradually rolled out to improve the earlier formatting of HTML. HTML+ also introduced 
                    navigation menus and dividers to break down Large Documents to help reduce latency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML+ was heavily influenced by the international standard of document markup at the time, the Standard 
                    Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML, defined by ISO 8879, markup structure help define document 
                    classes by the SGML Document Type Definition (DTD).
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML+, unlike SGML, does not attempt to define each possible user but instead defines support for a very 
                    wide range of display types. HTML+ aids in keeping browser software as simple - limiting the complexity 
                    that can be handled. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML+ favors the user defined settings of the browser to impact the formatting of the webpage. Browsers 
                    can avoid problems with page sizes and missing fonts. HTML+ conserves indispensable differences that are often 
                    lost by lower level procedural formats, making it easier to carry out processes like indexing and convertion 
                    into other document formats.

                    HTML 4, published in 1999, was the first version of HTML document building which introduced the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
                    as part of the HTML standard. HTML 4 is reliant on css documents for formating and display of the website providing 
                    prestine control of any information the page is hosting. As browsers improved to host HTML4 websites
                </p>

                <p>
                    XHTML, published in 2000, is output from certain Extensible Markup Language (XML) files, which use standard ASCII text, and mirrors or 
                    extends HTML versions with strict syntax rules, requiring perfect syntax to even run the XHTML, but it also allows developers to create their own objects and tags for each 
                    page in development. Introduces a uniform appearance to developed pages acoos a range of different browsers.

                    Development started for HTML's 5th Version of standards in 2007 with the official standard being released by W3C in 
                    October 2014. HTML5 become popular and dominant in webpage development by 2010, cooly taking over the XHTML standard 
                    and the old news of HTML 4. HTML5 introduce a slueth of new Tags and elements to help define document format and structure 
                    such as header, footer, audio, video, navigation tags, article, section etc. These tags opened up the possibility of styling elements 
                    using CSS within the element rather then having to selectively style the entire page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML5 relies heaviliy on additional scripts such as CSS and JavaScript for interactions, styling and any animations on 
                    the webpage. Though this version is easily the most interactive and adaptable when the webpage is developed using the 
                    combination of this HTML version, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery.
