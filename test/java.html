                    Java Script is used to enhance the way website behaves and is interacted with. It is supported by a range of browsers such
                    as; Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge/internet Explorer and a range of other browsers including Mobile phone browsers. 
                </p>

                    JavaScript improves the users experience of a web page by using dynamic component features making the most of the website's 
                    elements via programming.
                </p>

                <p>
                    how it works is the web browser loads up a web page, analyses and deconstructs the HTML to outline the website descriptors 
                    and creates a Document Object Model (DOM) from the loaded contents. The JavaScript code, in order to be presented to the user 
                    successfully, makes updates to the DOM live. This way it will also allow the ability to adjust your code live, to be notified 
                    on user interface events such as mouse clicks, button pressed, etc.

                    Netscape Communications started development of JavaScript in 1995 for use with their own Netscape browser. It was only 
                    when Netscape included Brendan Eich into the development project when the language was embedded. heavily inspired by Java 
                    syntax, and the inclusion of features of object orientation programs such as "SmallTalk", JavaScript was born. Although 
                    originally called "Mocha", May 1995, and then LiveScript, September 1995, it did not receive it's current name "JavaScript" 
                    until December in 1995.

                <p>
                     The browser begins a parser Process which first starts going through the HTML code to create the previously 
                     mentioned DOM. Whilst the parser is analysing the HTML document, the DOM is updated with the live view of the 
                     webpage including any triggers for any encounters of CSS and JavaScript. When the parser encounters any internal 
                     or external loaded CSS or JavaScript directives it will be passed on to the relevent parser. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The JavaScript Engine loads the script files, or code within the webpage document via "script" tags, and holds the actions of the 
                    programmed code on standby. Once the Parsaring of HTML and CSS are complete, the waiting script is executed in 
                    the order of what was first declared. These actions will directly update the DOM and then rendered onto the User's 
                    Browser.

                    JavaScript can be implemented into HTML documents or be externally loaded from it's own .js file.
                    Script tags will be used to declare JavaScript within the HTML Document itself whereas an external .js file will need to be linked 
                    appropriately.
                    
                    There are ways of loading JavaScript code dynamically and there are also whole frameworks dedicated to loading and running JavaScript 
                    modules with proper dependencies resolved at run time.
