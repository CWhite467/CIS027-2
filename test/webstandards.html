                    Web Standards are a series of recommendations which outline the expectations and compatibility of a website. These Web standards
                    allow for developers to ensure their website or web platform is accessible, reliable and universally
                    navigable without the risks to the user’s privacy and security being placed at risk (World Wide Web Consortium
                    (W3C), 2006).
                </p>

                <p>
                    These standards are defined through a series of decisions made within the consortium, which is made of several member groups
                    of the organisation, with recommendations only being approved via a consensus. The consensus is usually
                    reached after sufficient experimentations and research into the proposed recommendation which was submitted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Modern use of the Web is evolving, so must the standards. By future proofing one’s website, a developer increases
                    the likelihood of recognition and customer usability. These standards help improve the overall feel,
                    security and execution of the website’s purpose.

                    the addition of more interactive and automated systems integrated into the Web platform. According to
                    (World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 2005) there are seven main points in which the W3C standards which
